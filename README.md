# The-Spine
Backbone of mankind
Text:Echo off
This is a collaberation of ideas addressing problems concerning humans and their spine.  This piece of architecture is such an important and under-rated 
piece of the human puzzle.  Rarely is it addressed when one does not suffer from the effects it can produce since basically out of sight - out of mind.
The potential problem with this, especially with the population getting older and lets face it, socially technological revolution causing many to sit 
around on their behinds more and more.  In turn not only are the butts getting bigger but the spine is suffering severely and soon we will face the older 
hunchback generation aganonizing in pain due partly or mainly from gravity weighting down this most important strength of the human body.
This project attempts to address this and hopefuly generate some ideas to not only prevent but even help in the healing process of those already in need.
